# KeplerAs
Assembler for NVIDIA Kepler(gk110, k20/k40, sm_35) architecture
KeplerAs is based on maxas: git://github.com/NervanaSystems/maxas.git
Kepler GPU architecture differs from Maxwell in instruction encoding and control code
(every 7 instructions a control code).
KeplerAs's help guide is similar to maxas, please refer it.
KeplerAs able to convert assembly to cubin.
Our KeplerAs support about 60 Kepler instructions.
More are working in progress.
Our documents will come soon.
